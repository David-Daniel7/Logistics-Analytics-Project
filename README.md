# Logistics-Analytics-Project
📌 Project Overview  This project demonstrates a logistics analytics dashboard built in Power BI using a sample dataset created to represent real-world shipping and transportation operations. The dashboard provides actionable insights into financial performance, operational efficiency, and delivery trends within logistics.
📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

Shipment details: TripID, ShipperID, CategoryID, Customer

Timeline info: ShipDate, DeliveryDate, ShipDays

Route data: Origin & Destination (City, State)

Operations: TotalMiles, LoadedMiles, Capacity, CheckPoints

Financials: ShippingCost, Revenue, Profitability

⚠️ Note: This dataset is synthetic and created for practice purposes only.
